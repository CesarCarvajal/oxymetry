Changes and Ideas for Code:

- Relation between Preview and Polarimetry Tabs:

1. The first Spectrometer available and checked from the Preview List should appear in the List of Spectrometers for Polarimetry.
Therefore, the settings from that spectrometer should be showed.

2. If there is any spectrometer checked, the polarimeter tab asks to select one from preview list.

3. If you change Integration Time, Number of Average, Name, Saturation or Autoadjust from any of the tabs (preview or polarimeter,
both lists should update with the new settings.

4. When measuring with Polarimeter Tab, the preview should be desactivated and viceversa.

5. The plot of the spectrometer selected on the preview list should be shown in the first plot of the polarimeter tab. 

Problems:

- If I change the integration time from Preview, The list of polarimeter is updated, but not viceversa.

- How to disable buttons of preview from polarimeter tab.
